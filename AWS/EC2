** EC2-Instance 
-- Amazon Web Services EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute) is a web service that offers resizable compute capacity in the Amazon Web Services cloud. 
-- It provides Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to its consumers (IaaS). 
-- It gives you full control over your computing resources, which you can scale as needed.
-- EC2 instance is simply a virtual server in Amazon Web Services terminology..
-- Amazon EC2 provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS Cloud. 
-- It allows you to launch virtual servers, known as instances, on-demand. 
-- This helps reduce hardware costs and speeds up application development and deployment..

** How to create 
-- In memory configuration we can set as different combination of CPU , RAM (MEMORY) ..
-- we need to select Instance Type for creation time (t2.Small, t2.nano, t2.large)
-- need to set network configuration , if previously created , then also we can use and create easily ... 
-- (mostly select TYPE --All trafic ,  port range -- All , protocol - All)
   ( TYPE- NFS , Protocol - TCP , Port range -- 2049   == For ECS task triggered if needed )


** How EC2 Works 
-- EC2 handles scaling according to changing needs using the AWS Management Console, 
AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs), 
and makes it easy to deploy virtual servers and maintain storage.

** How instances are categorized in AWS EC2?
Instances are classified into three categorize.

1] On-Demand Instances:--
-- In case of On-Demand, there are no long-term contracts. 
-- They bill you per hour for the compute capacity you use. 
-- Companies may scale up or down the capacity of their application based on demand, and they only pay for the hourly rate of the instance they select.

2] Reserved Instances (RI):--
-- These instances offer a significant discount (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand pricing when you commit to using them for a 1 or 3-year term.
-- Best for steady-state or predictable usage applications, such as databases.

3] Spot instances:--
-- These instances allow you to bid on unused EC2 capacity at a lower price, which can result in significant cost savings.
-- Suitable for flexible workloads, such as batch processing, data analysis, and workloads that can be interrupted.
